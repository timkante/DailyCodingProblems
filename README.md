This Problem was recently asked by _Google_.

Given a list of numbers, and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k = 17`, return true, since `10 + 7 = 17`.

<a href="src/main/kotlin/Task002.kt">Coding Problem #2 - [hard]</a>
</summary>

This problem was asked by _Uber_.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.

* [x] Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
